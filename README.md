The [Startup Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/startup-trigger-plugin) plugin allows you to trigger a build when Jenkins nodes (controller/agent) start.

## Support

Hey dude! Help me out for a couple of :beers: or a :coffee:!

## Configuration

This plugin requires a jenkins restart (it will not work using install without restart). After installation you will find a new Build Trigger "Build when job nodes start" tickbox is available in the job configuration of each job.

### Restricted node Label

By default this value is blank and the job will start (once) whenever the Jenkins controller starts.  Alternatively, you can specify a node label or a space separated list of nodes labels like:

    LABEL_A LABEL_B

Or a label expression:

    LABEL_A && LABEL_B

This plugin will trigger builds when any node matching this/these labels is started.  This includes when the controller is restarted, as each matching node reconnects the job will be re-executed.

### Quiet period

Defaults to zero, allows you to specify the [Quiet Period](https://jenkins.io/blog/2010/08/11/quiet-period-feature/) before scheduling the job.

## Advanced Configuration

### Node parameter name

The parameter name for Startup Trigger to use when specifying which node triggered the job.  Useful if the default NodeLabelParameter value is a label and you want to run the job on the node that triggered the job's execution.

This can also reference a StringParameter, if instead you want the name of the started node to be handed to a job as an argument.

### Trigger build on

This pulldown provides a few options for what types of startup events should trigger builds:

- Run on initial connection (Default)
  - This will trigger when a node first connects to Jenkins (JNLP, SSH, DCOM, etc..)
- Run when node brought online
  - This will trigger when a node is "Temporarily Reconnected".  For example: Node was previously "Marked as offline" and has now been brought online.
- Both
  - Use this value to specify that both events should trigger build execution

## Development Environment

This plugin seems to build successfully in all versions of Maven. The current release (2.9.4) builds with `3.9.3` and `3.9.4`.  Startup-Trigger builds with Temurin's JDK 11 and 17.
